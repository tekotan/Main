			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello! I am Tanish Baranwal and I am a developer working on many projects! I know many programming languages. I know Python, CSS,
				Javascript, HTML, SQL, and very little PHP. I just started learning tensorflow. Tensorflow is a powerful module made by Google that uses prebuild
			computational functions to assist with machine learning. View the tensorflow section <a href="#tensorflow">below</a>. I have been using this to make projects. As the projects are finished, I will post a demo and
			some slides explaining the problem, the application, and the architecture. To be informed when I post a project, signup for the <a href="#cta">mailing list</a>.
